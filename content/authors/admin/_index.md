I'm a Physics PhD candidate at [Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu/physics/), where I build computational models to understand the strange world of quantum materials.

My research lies at the intersection of computational physics and condensed matter theory. I specialize in developing advanced numerical algorithms to simulate complex phenomena in strongly correlated and disordered quantum systems. A core part of my work involves the development and application of quantum embedding theories, such as Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, to probe the non-equilibrium dynamics of these systems. I'm also captivated by the fascinating physics of non-Hermitian quantum phenomena, including the non-Hermitian skin effect. At LSU, I am fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Juana Moreno](https://www.lsu.edu/physics/people/faculty/moreno.php) and [Dr. Ka-Ming Tam](http://tamkaming.com/cms/). 

My journey in physics includes a BS-MS Dual Degree from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in). For my MS thesis, I contributed to the [LITESOPH](https://aitgcodes.github.io/litesoph-website/index.html) project by developing efficient scientific codes to model non-adiabatic dynamics. I've also had the privilege of applying my skills in diverse settings, including a summer internship at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov) modeling non-linear light-matter interactions and as a long-term research visitor at [Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Studies](https://www.jncasr.ac.in).

When I'm not running simulations, I enjoy playing cricket, table tennis, and chess. I'm an avid chess player on Chess.com (rapid controls are my favorite). Fancy a game? Challenge me: qtinkerer.

I'm always open to discussing physics, new research, or potential collaborations. Feel free to explore my [publications](#featured), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chakradhar-rangi/).
